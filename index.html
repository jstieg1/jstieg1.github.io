        <h3>1) Jonathan Taylor (RB1) <small>Indianapolis Colts</small></h3>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/xQp3OH5ITsCrrHGSK0mx">
        <p>As the reigning number 1 scoring running back, Jonathan Taylor has nothing to prove going into this new NFL seson. He has dominated in college and since entering the league in 2020. That is not likely to change as the Colts still have a top 3 offensive line and an upgrade at quarterback. New QB Matt Ryan loved to throw to his RBs in Atlanta as he average 8 targets to that position per game. Additionlly, Taylor has never missed significant time with injury and is known to be a durable player. Draft him in your leagues and enjoy a reliable 20 points per game.  </p>

        <h3>2) Christian McCaffrey (RB2) <small>Carolina Panthers</small></h3>

        <p>CMC is the most controversial player in draft this year. The past 2 years have been a disater for those who drafted CMC. Multiple lower body injuries have derailed his historic run that started in 2018. McCaffrey was the 2nd highest scoring running back in 2018 and then posted the most points for a non QB in fantasy football history in 2019. His 2019 year was good enough to single-handedly win people their leagues. What changed sisnce then? Well McCaffrey rolled his ankle a couple times on 310lb lineman. No traumatic injuries or surgeries; just unfortunate minor injuries. Now many people are willing to avoid him and label him injury prone even after the Panthers traded for Baker Mayfield. Playing fantasy football is about winning it all, not avoiding last place. While he may come with a bit of risk (as all RBs do), CMC staying healthy will win you your season. Draft him confidently as the risk is moderate but the reward is league-winning. P.S. CMC averaged 29.7 points per game in 2019, with backups Kyle Allen and Will Grier as his quarterbacks. </p>

        <h3>3) Justin Jefferson (WR1) <small>Minnesota Vikings</small></h3>

        <p>It's official, he has the best early carrer of any NFL Wide Receiver. In their first two years in the league, no wideout has had more yards than Justin Jefferson. The players that were closest to his pace are Odell Beckham Jr., Randy Moss, and Jerry Rice. Some good company if you ask me. Paired with a good qb in Kirk Cousins and a new Offesnive minded head coach, Jefferson is ready to be the highest scoring WR thsi year.</p>
